<div>CSS box model is a container which contains multiple properties including borders, margin, padding and the content itself. It is used to create the design and layout of web pages. It can be used as a toolkit for customizing the layout of different elements. The web browser renders every element as a rectangular box according to the CSS box model. 
Box-Model has multiple properties in CSS. Some of them are given below: 
<ul>
        <li><strong >Borders </strong></li>
        <li><strong >Margins </strong></li>
        <li><strong >Padding </strong></li>
        <li><strong >Content </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong >Border Area:</strong> It is the area between the box’s padding and margin. Its dimensions are given by the width and height of border.</p>

<p><strong >Margin Area:</strong> This area consists of space between border and margin. The dimensions of Margin area are the margin-box width and the margin-box height. It is useful to separate the element from its neighbors.</p>
